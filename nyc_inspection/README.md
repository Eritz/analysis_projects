##New York City Health Inspection Record Quick Analysis

This is a quick analysis of one of New York City's many open datasets. I downloaded this dataset on July 7th 
from https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59. 
This dataset has information of violations, grades, and inspection details on New York City restaurants throughout the five boroughs.

I use pandas's groupby and various aggregation functions within the Ipython notebook.
